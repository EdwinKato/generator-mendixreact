> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for Mendix widgets using react, typescript and webpack.

## About

This generator uses the Yeoman scaffolding tool to let you quickly create a [Mendix widget] that uses react, typescript and webpack

## Prerequisites _(you only have to do this once)_

First, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. (We recommend a 4.x LTS version, the widget is tested against version 4 to 6). After that, you need to install Yeoman .

Open a command-line window (Press Win+R and type ``cmd`` or use Powershell)

```bash
  npm install -g yo grunt-cli
```
Clone this repo to a folder of your choice then run npm link inside that folder
```
